
# Enhanced Sentiment Analysis with Transformer Models

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements **Sentiment Analysis** using four transformer models:
- **XLM-RoBERTa**
- **BERT**
- **DistilBERT Base Uncased**
- **RoBERTa**

The objective is to classify textual reviews into sentiments (positive, negative, or neutral) and provide insights into product reviews.

## 🚀 Features
- Multi-model sentiment classification with **>90% accuracy**.
- Supports **multiple languages** via translation.
- Backend integration for real-time review analysis.

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset consists of two files:
- **train.csv**: Used for training the models.
- **test.csv**: Used for model evaluation.

## ⚙️ Installation
